## Plug.bot

##Edited by thedark1337

A collection of extensions to the growing online DJing website, <a href="http://plug.dj">plug.dj</a>.  The source code is written in JavaScript and uses the Plug.dj API anywhere possible.  Easily embeddable as a bookmark in your favorite browser.  Initially inspired by TechGuard's AutoWoot script from April 2012.



### Features List ###

Feature | Purpose
--------|--------
Auto Woot | Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
Auto Queue | Automatically add yourself back to the DJ Waitlist once you've been moved back into the crowd
Userlist | A dynamic list of every user in the room, color-coded by their current vote.  Green = "Woot", Red = "Meh", White = No vote  Special usergroups (i.e. moderator) are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat
Toggle UI | Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button.  Red = Off, Green = On
Hide Video | Hides videos from view on the site -- this is in effect until disabled
Skip Video | This is exactly like hide video, except it additionally mutes the audio and will automatically re-enable everything after the current video is over
